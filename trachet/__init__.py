This program runs as a terminal filter process between terminals and applications.
It provides step-by-step debugging and formatted sequence tracing service.
You can watch terminal I/O sequence on realtime, and it enables you to do step-by-step execution.

Most of terminal applications such as vi have single threaded UI and typically has blocking terminal I/O.
So trachet might be useful for both of terminal emulator developers and terminal application developers.
